URL Friendly slugs for Meteor
------------------------
This package has two main purposes:

1. Make it easy to create a sanitized and URL friendly slug based off of an existing field
2. Auto-increment the slug if needed to ensure each item has a unique URL

Work in progress, I have the insert items complete, still need to write the update hook...
